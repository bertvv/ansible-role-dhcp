# Ansible role `dhcp`

Ansible role for setting up ISC DHCPD. The responsibilities of this role are to install packages and manage the configuration ([dhcpd.conf(5)](http://linux.die.net/man/5/dhcpd.conf)). Managing the firewall configuration is NOT a concern of this role. You can do this in your local playbook, or use another role (e.g. [bertvv.rh-base](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/rh-base).

Refer to the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes in each release.

Do you use/like this role? Please consider giving it a star. If you [rate this role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/dhcp) on Ansible Galaxy and find it lacking in some respect, please consider opening an Issue with actionable feedback or a PR so we can improve it. Thank you!

## Requirements

No specific requirements

## Role Variables

This role is able to set global options, and to specify subnet declarations.

See the [test playbook](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-dhcp/blob/vagrant-tests/test.yml) for a working example of a DHCP server in a test environment based on Vagrant and VirtualBox. This section is a reference of all supported options.

### Global options

The following variables, when set, will be added to the global section of the DHCP configuration file. If there is no default value specified, the corresponding setting will be left out of `dhcpd.conf(5)`.

See the [dhcp-options(5)](http://linux.die.net/man/5/dhcp-options) man page for more information about these options.

**Remarks**

(1) This role supports the definition of classes with a match statement, e.g.:

```Yaml
# Class for VirtualBox VMs
dhcp_global_classes:
  - name: vbox
    match: 'match if binary-to-ascii(16,8,":",substring(hardware, 1, 3)) = "8:0:27"'
```

Class names can be used in the definition of address pools (see below).

(2) The role variable `dhcp_global_domain_name_servers` may be written either as a list (when you have more than one item), or as a string (when you have only one). The following snippet shows an example of both:

```Yaml
# A single DNS server
dhcp_global_domain_name_servers: 8.8.8.8

# A list of DNS servers
dhcp_global_domain_name_servers:
  - 8.8.8.8
  - 8.8.4.4
```

(3) This role also supports the definition of a failover peer, e.g.:

```Yaml
# Failover peer definition
dhcp_global_failover_peer: failover-group
dhcp_global_failover:
  role: primary # | secondary
  address: 192.168.222.2
  port: 647
  peer_address: 192.168.222.3
  peer_port: 647
  max_response_delay: 15
  max_unacked_updates: 10
  load_balance_max_seconds: 5
  split: 255
  mclt: 3600
```

The variable `dhcp_global_failover_peer` contains a name for the configured peer, to be used on a per pool basis. The failover declaration options are specified with the variable `dhcp_global_failover`, a dictionary that may contain the following options:

| Option                     | Required | Comment                                                               |

| `peer_address`             | no       | Failover peer's IP addres                                             |
| `peer_port`                | no       | This server's port (generally 519/520 or 647/847)                     |
| `port`                     | no       | This server's port (generally 519/520 or 647/847)                     |
| `role`                     | no       | primary, secondary                                                    |
| `split`                    | no       | Load balance split (0-255)                                            |

The failover peer directive has to be in the definition of address pools (see below).

### DDNS updates

The role allows to add hosts via DDNS to domain name servers.

You will need the following:

* A key for communication with the primary DNS server
* Zone definitions
* `dhcp_global_ddns_updates: on
* A domain name in the subnet where hosts that should update are defined

```dhcp_global_ddns_updates: on
dhcp_keys:
  - name: EXAMPLE
    algorithm: hmac-md5
    secret: "mysecretkeyhash"
dhcp_zones:
  - name: 42.168.192.in-addr.arpa
    primary: 192.168.42.19
    key: EXAMPLE
  - name: example.com
    primary: 192.168.42.19
    key: EXAMPLE
dhcp_subnets:
  - ip: 192.168.42.0
    netmask: 255.255.255.0
    domain_name_servers: 192.168.42.19
    range_begin: 192.168.42.150
    range_end: 192.168.42.250
    routers: 192.168.42.1
    ddns_domainname: example.com
    hosts:
      - name: cl1
        mac: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
        ip: 192.168.42.69
        ddns-hostname: gulveig
```

The `ddns-hostname` is automatically set to a valid DNS name that matches the name of the host.

More on DDNS with dhcpd can be found in the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/DDNS).

### Subnet declarations

The role variable `dhcp_subnets` contains a list of dicts, specifying the subnet declarations to be added to the DHCP configuration file. Every subnet declaration should have an `ip` and `netmask`, other options are not mandatory. We start this section with an example, a complete overview of supported options follows.

```Yaml
dhcp_subnets:
  - ip: 192.168.222.0
    netmask: 255.255.255.128
    domain_name_servers:
      - 10.0.2.3
      - 10.0.2.4
    range_begin: 192.168.222.50
    range_end: 192.168.222.127
  - ip: 192.168.222.128
    default_lease_time: 3600
    max_lease_time: 7200
    netmask: 255.255.255.128
    domain_name_servers: 10.0.2.3
    ddns_domainname: example.com
    routers: 192.168.222.129
```

An alphabetical list of supported options in a subnet declaration:

| Option                | Required | Comment                                                               |
| :---                  | :---:    | :--                                                                   |

| `filename`            | no       | filename to retrieve from boot server                                 |
| `hosts`               | no       | List of fixed IP address hosts for each subnet, similar to dhcp_hosts |
| `ip`                  | yes      | **Required.** IP address of the subnet                                |

| `ntp_servers`         | no       | List of NTP servers for this subnet                                   |
| `range_begin`         | no       | Lowest address in the range of dynamic IP addresses to be assigned    |
| `range_end`           | no       | Highest address in the range of dynamic IP addresses to be assigned   |
| `ranges`              | no       | If multiple ranges are needed, they can be specified as a list (2)    |
| `routers`             | no       | IP address of the gateway for this subnet                             |

| `subnet_mask`         | no       | Overrides the `netmask` of the subnet declaration                     |

You can specify address pools within a subnet by setting the `pools` options. This allows you to specify a pool of addresses that will be treated differently than another pool of addresses, even on the same network segment or subnet. It is a list of dicts with the following keys, all of which are optional:

| Option                | Comment                                             |
| :---                  | :---                                                |
| `allow`               | Specifies which hosts are allowed in this pool(1)   |
| `default_lease_time`  | The default lease time for this pool                |
| `deny`                | Specifies which hosts are not allowed in this pool  |
| `domain_name_servers` | The domain name servers to be used for this pool(1) |
| `max_lease_time`      | The maximum lease time for this pool                |
| `min_lease_time`      | The minimum lease time for this pool                |
| `range_begin`         | The lowest address in this pool                     |
| `range_end`           | The highest address in this pool                    |

(1) For the `allow` and `deny` fields, the options are enumerated in [dhcpd.conf(5)](http://linux.die.net/man/5/dhcpd.conf), but include:

- `booting`
- `bootp`
- `client-updates`
- `known-clients`
- `members of "CLASS"`
- `unknown-clients`

(2) For multiple subnet ranges, they can be specified, thus:

```Yaml
ranges:
  - { begin: 192.168.222.50, end: 192.168.222.99 }
  - { begin: 192.168.222.110, end: 192.168.222.127 }
```

### Host declarations

You can specify hosts that should get a fixed IP address based on their MAC by setting the `dhcp_hosts` option. This is a list of dicts with the following three keys, of which `name` and `mac` are mandatory:

| Option | Comment                                   |
| :---   | :---                                      |
| `name` | The name of the host                      |
| `mac`  | The MAC address of the host               |
| `ip`   | The IP address to be assigned to the host |

```Yaml
dhcp_hosts:
  - name: cl1
    mac: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
    ip: 192.168.222.150
  - name: cl2
    mac: '00:de:ad:be:ef:00'
    ip: 192.168.222.151
```

### Specify PXEBoot server

Setting the variable `dhcp_pxeboot_server`, will redirect PXE clients to the specified PXEBoot server in order to boot over the network. The specified server should have boot images on the expected locations. Use e.g. [bertvv.pxeserver](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/pxeserver) to configure it.

### Custom Includes

Setting the variable `dhcp_custom_inludes` to a jinja template will allow custom configurations to be used which will subsiquently be included into the `dhcpd.conf` file. 

```Yaml
dhcp_custom_includes:
  - custom-dhcp-config.conf
```

You can create your own variables to use within the template allowing for total flexibility. To avoid variable conflicts make sure that you use variables that are not referenced within this role as this will duplicate configuration in multiple `.conf` files.

```Yaml
    dhcp_custom_hosts:
      - name: Juniper1
        mac: 'de:ad:c0:de:ca:fe'
        ip: 192.168.35.160
        options:
          - name: tftp-server-name
            value: 192.168.35.152
          - name: host-name
            value: Juniper1
          - name: NEW_OP.transfer-mode
            value: "http"
          - name: NEW_OP.config-file-name
            value: "/configurations/j1-switch.config"
```

Finally the jinja template must contain valid ISC DHCPD configuration ([dhcpd.conf(5)](http://linux.die.net/man/5/dhcpd.conf)). This is an example of using [bertvv.dhcp](https://galaxy.ansible.com/bertvv/dhcp) for juniper Zero-Touch-Provisioning.

```Jinja
option space NEW_OP;
option NEW_OP.image-file-name code 0 = text;
option NEW_OP.config-file-name code 1 = text;
option NEW_OP.image-file-type code 2 = text;
option NEW_OP.transfer-mode code 3 = text;
option NEW_OP.alt-image-file-name code 4= text;
option NEW_OP.http-port code 5= text;
option NEW_OP-encapsulation code 43 = encapsulate NEW_OP;
